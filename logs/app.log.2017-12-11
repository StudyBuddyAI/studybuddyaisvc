To realize the dreams and impact of AI requires autonomous systems that learn to make good decisions. Reinforcement learning is one powerful paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range of tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning, and thereby also a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its behaviour; this is known as the reinforcement signal.\nThere are many different algorithms that tackle this issue. As a matter of fact, Reinforcement Learning is defined by a specific type of problem, and all its solutions are classed as Reinforcement Learning algorithms. In the problem, an agent is supposed decide the best action to select based on his current state. When this step is repeated, the problem is known as a Markov Decision Process.\nReinforcement Learning allows the machine or software agent to learn its behaviour based on feedback from the environment. This behaviour can be learnt once and for all, or keep on adapting as time goes by. If the problem is modelled with care, some Reinforcement Learning algorithms can converge to the global optimum; this is the ideal behaviour that maximises the reward.\nThis automated learning scheme implies that there is little need for a human expert who knows about the domain of application. Much less time will be spent designing a solution, since there is no need for hand-crafting complex sets of rules as with Expert Systems, and all that is required is someone familiar with Reinforcement Learning.', 'title_id': '5a2f1896e3e52a462102ffd5', 'qas': []}
